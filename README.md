Spraycan - a post digital experiment
====================================

Just imagine! You are able to spray graffiti on nearly every wall in the world, completely legaly!?
Spraycan is a collaborative project of [Christian Bromann](christian-bromann.com) and [Marius Foerster](mezla.de)
which can make this happen!

**The idea:** take a walk in Googles StreetView mode to find a nice spot for tagging. A
special prepared spraycan with an bulb on the top sends light signals to a camera. The webapp
finds the lightspot and draws something on a canvas. After finishing your masterpiece you can
press a red button to publish the image. An Arduino microcontroller in the spraycan controls all
user actions and sends events via Bluetooth and serial connection to a nodeJS server. Watch the
video to get a better comprehension for that.
