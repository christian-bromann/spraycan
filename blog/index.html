    <h1>
        "Spraycan" is an interactive installation, fathom the uncertain line between
        reality and the digital world.
    </h1>
    <p>
        For everyone Graffiti means something different. It stands for rebellion,
        protest, getting rid of standards, anger, aggression and the search for
        adrenalin and challenges. It‘s art, an experiment with colors and shapes,
        style, abstraction, a message, need for recognition, fame and culture.
        It‘s a game between anonymity and publicity, especially in the world of
        illegal graffiti. Tags, Throw-ups, Pieces and so on are an inherent part
        of cities and specially made for this purpose, regardless of their intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The documentation of the work and even of the action itself seems to be as
        much important as the moment of doing it. Internet, galleries, magazines
        and books, they all create a platform delivering the piece to the whole
        world ripped out its environment. The photography as an pretended truth
        transform it to an digital unit, administrable in the world wide web.
        But it‘s not my aim to question the realness of nowadays graffiti. I‘m
        interested in how much the digital publishing of graffiti influences
        the writer‘s intention and if there is a change of mind about anonymity
        and publicity and the choice of places. What criteria lead to the decision
        spraying at a specific place? Is it perfectly visible for passing pedestrians
        and cars or is it a perfect photo spot? Do I maybe also refer to topics, that
        are discussed local or global? How important is it to put paint on a surface,
        of someones property, you didn‘t ask for permission? Is it possible to produce
        the graffiti digital? Does „Spraycan“ evoke the same or similar feelings? If
        yes, what kind of? How does the interface change the action? Could something
        new arise or is it disappointing and thus it reveal a truth?
    </p>
    <p>
        An experiment how digital reality influence urban art: The can and to this
        related moves stay the same, extended by the function of triggering the
        documentation off. Paint is replaced by light, enabling the simulation of
        lines on the digital map. Google Street View render the urban space, possible
        to check out spots, spray and keep records of them and show it to digital public.
